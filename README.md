# obs-multi-hotkey-image

*Python Script for OBS Studio*

Reveal any image from a folder using a dedicated hotkey.
Works in push-to-show mode by default.
The hotkey for each image file can be configured
in the "Hotkeys" section of OBS' settings.

**Example Images: Online Meeting Icons**
The images folder distributed with this script contains
a few icons (by Font Awesome) useful when using
the virtual camera in OBS for video conferencing.
